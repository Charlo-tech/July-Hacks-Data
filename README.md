# The Data Story
The visualization tells the story of different pokemons and their strengths and categories of pokemons. It also shows the distribution of pokemons in different generations and the distribution of pokemons in different types.
# Thought Process
We considered jupyter notebooks for the visualization but we wanted the portability of a web app, and so we settled on react to sharpen our API knowledge and have a clean look.
